Data Analysis Projects:-

This repository contains a collection of my data analysis projects. Each project focuses on different areas of data analysis, including predictive modeling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning applications. The projects are written in Python and use libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, and more.

Projects Overview:-

1.Supermart Grocery Sales - Retail Analytics:-
  Analyzed grocery sales data from a supermarket to understand sales trends and predict future sales using linear regression and other machine learning techniques.

  Used feature engineering, data preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into sales patterns, seasonality, and category-wise contributions.

2.Stock Market Analysis:-
  Analyzed historical stock price data for Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, and Google.

  Implemented trend analysis, moving averages, volatility calculation, and correlation analysis to understand market behavior.

  Applied machine learning models for predicting stock prices based on historical data.

3.Supply Chain Management:-
  Analyzed supply chain data to predict revenue generation using random forest regression.

  Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the relationships between different variables affecting revenue, such as product type, transportation modes, and suppliers.

4.Furniture Sales Prediction:-
  Worked with an e-commerce furniture dataset to predict the number of furniture items sold based on various product attributes.

  Used machine learning techniques, including Random Forest and linear regression, for predictive modeling.

  Generated insights on the impact of product categories and pricing on sales performance.

5.Electric Vehicle Sales in India:-
  Analyzed sales data of electric vehicles in India to understand market trends and factors affecting sales.

  Performed regression analysis and model building to predict future sales, with a focus on market growth, policy changes, and infrastructure development.


Technologies Used:-
Python: Core programming language for data analysis and machine learning.
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Numerical computing and array manipulation.
matplotlib & seaborn: Data visualization libraries for generating plots and graphs.
scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for model building and evaluation.
SQL: Used for querying databases (in some projects).
Jupyter Notebooks: Interactive environment for coding and documentation.


Project Structure:-
Each project contains the following components:

Data: The raw data used for analysis (CSV or Excel files).
Scripts: Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model training.
Results: Visualizations, model evaluation metrics, and conclusions drawn from the analysis.


What We Learned:-
   Supermart Grocery Sales: We learned how sales are affected by time, product categories, and seasonality. The model demonstrated that proper feature selection and encoding are critical for predictive accuracy.

   Stock Market Analysis: Correlation analysis helped us understand the relationships between different stock prices. Moving averages and volatility calculations provided insights into market trends.

   Supply Chain Management: The revenue prediction model gave us insights into how different variables affect revenue generation in supply chain operations.

   Furniture Sales Prediction: Predicting sales based on product attributes helped us identify key factors influencing furniture sales, such as category and pricing strategies.

   Electric Vehicle Sales in India: The analysis highlighted the potential growth of the electric vehicle market in India, with factors like government policies and infrastructure playing a significant role.


Future Improvements:-
   Supermart Grocery Sales: Implement more advanced models such as Random Forest or XGBoost to improve prediction accuracy.

   Stock Market Analysis: Integrate more technical indicators, such as RSI or MACD, and try time series forecasting models like ARIMA.

   Supply Chain Management: Explore time series forecasting for demand prediction and optimize the supply chain using advanced machine learning models.

   Furniture Sales Prediction: Incorporate external factors like promotions and discounts to improve the accuracy of sales predictions.

   Electric Vehicle Sales: Incorporate more features like customer demographics and region-specific data for more granular predictions.
